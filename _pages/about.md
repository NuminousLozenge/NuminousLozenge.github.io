I am an undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). Previously, I have worked as a research intern at the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), focusing on multi-agent reinforcement learning. Prior to that, I was a part of [Centre For Innovation \| IIT Madras](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/), where I contributed to developing autonomous vehicles and participated in international robotics competitions.

I am interested in a range of topics in robotics and artificial intelligence, such as path planning, control of multi-agent systems and data-driven reinforcement learning. My goal is to develop safe, robust, and scalable autonomous vehicle technologies.
