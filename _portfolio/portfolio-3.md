title: "Team Abhiyaan : Autonomous Mobile Robot Simulation"
excerpt: "At [Team Abhiyaan](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/competition-teams/team-abhiyaan), I developed a simulation based on ROS and Gazebo to rigorously test various path planning and perception algorithms before deploying them on real hardware. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/NuminousLozenge/virat-simulation)<br/><img src='/images/abhiyaan/virat_test.gif' height='300'>"
