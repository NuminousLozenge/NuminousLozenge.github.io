title: "Team Abhiyaan : Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC)"
excerpt: " At [Team Abhiyaan](https://cfi.iitm.ac.in/competition-teams/team-abhiyaan) I worked on building "Vikram", a vision-based autonomous mobile robot. With Vikram, we competed in the AutoNav and Cyber challenge at the 30th Annual Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition ([IGVC](http://www.igvc.org/index.htm)) in the USA. I contributed to this project by developing and testing path planners and motion controllers for the robot, further I developed a simulation to rigorously test the robot's features. Our hard work resulted in **winning 1st place in both the AutoNav Design and Cyber challenges**.
